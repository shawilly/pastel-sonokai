### 🎨 From Monokai to Ponokai
Inspired by the classic [Monokai](https://monokai.pro/vscode) theme and seeking a less eye-straining alternative, I transitioned to [Sonokai](https://github.com/sainnhe/sonokai). Despite the improvements, my quest for the perfect pastel blend led me to craft Ponokai, merging the best of Sonokai with the soothing palette of modern themes like [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim).

Ponokai is a direct fork of Sonokai, maintaining all its features and continuing to evolve with fresh, pastel-inspired tweaks for the color aficionado.

### 🌟 Features
- **Perfect Contrast:** High enough to pop, soft enough to relax.
- **Vivid, Pastel Colors:** A palette that's easy on the eyes.
- **Customization Galore:** Tailor it to your taste.
- **Extensive Support:** Works beautifully with common file types and plugins.
- **Advanced Syntax Highlighting:**
  - Tree-sitter support for precise highlighting.
  - Semantic highlighting to distinguish code by meaning.
  - [Italic support](https://aka.sainnhe.dev/fonts) for that extra flair.
